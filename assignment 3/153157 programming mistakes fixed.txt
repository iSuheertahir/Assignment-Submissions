1: Undeclared Variables:

int main()
{
cin>>x;
cout<<x;
}

"Huh? Why do I get an error?"

	The varible 'x' isn't declared within the scope of the main
	function, therefore, it doesn't work.
	In order to operate, it should be like this:

	int main()
	{
		datatype x;
		cin>>x;
		cout<<x;
	}

	The datatype could possibly be the choice of programmer, for
	what he/she, want the type of input to be entered and displayed.
	int, char, string, float, double... These are some of the datatypes
	mentioned that is to be explicitly mentioned, insted of the word
	'datatype' written in the above code in main function...
 
x---------------------------------------------------------------------x

2: Uninitialized variables:

int count;
while(count<100)
{
cout<<count;
}

"Why doesn't my program enter the while loop?"

	The varible declared is not initialized, i.e. it has not been
	assigned a default value, therefore, it is quite possible
	that there might be some garbage value that resides in the
	declared but uninitialized varible already, which might be less
	than 100.

x---------------------------------------------------------------------x

3: Setting a variable to an uninitialized value:

int a, b;
int sum=a+b;
cout<<"Enter two numbers to add: ";
cin>>b;
cout<<"The sum is: "<<sum;
When Run:
Enter two numbers to add: 1 3
The sum is: -1393

"What's wrong with my program?"

	The sum of the two uninitialized variables 'a' and 'b' is assigned
	to the varible sum. Being uninitialized, just so as it happens
	to be, these variables 'a' and 'b' have some garbage value in
	them, that adds up to be equal to the number '-1393'. The values
	are later entered by the user in the variables 'a' and 'b',
	regerdless of the fact there is no summation done afer input
	that is stored in the variable sum! Furthermore, according to the
	code, the user inputs only a single value in variable 'b' and no 
	input is taken for variable 'a'.
	Therefore, the correct code would be: 

		int a, b, sum;
		cout << "Enter two numbers to add: " << endl;
		cin >> b;
		cin >> a;
		sum = a + b;
		cout << "The sum is: "<<sum;
		When Run:
		Enter two numbers to add: 
		1
		3
		The sum is: 4

x---------------------------------------------------------------------x

4: Using a single equal sign to check equality:

char x='Y';
while(x='Y')
{
//...
cout<<"Continue? (Y/N)";
cin>>x;
}

"Why doesn't my loop ever end?"

	The while loop keeps on repeating itself until and unless the
	condition stated is turned false. In this case, the variable
	is assigned the value of the character 'Y', first on its declaration,
	second in the while loop's condition checking area. What happens is,
	The value of 'Y' is constantly assigned to x, whenever the conditional
	comparison happens in the while loop and hence, an endless loop
	executes...
	The correct code would be:
		
		char x='Y';
		while(x=='Y')
		{
			//...
			cout<<"Continue? (Y/N)";
			cin>>x;
		}
	
	The double equal sign compares the value in the variable x with the
	charachter 'Y' (in the condition checking area of the while loop)
	and operates if the comparison is true.

x---------------------------------------------------------------------x 

5: Undeclared Functions:

int main()
{
menu();
}
void menu()
{
//...
}

"Why do I get an error about menu being unknown?"

	There are two ways to to write functions.
	1) by declaring a function with all it's complete details before
	   the main() function. e.g.

			void menu()
			{
				//...
			}
			int main()
			{
				menu();
			}

	2) by declaring the function's prototype first (only returntype of function
	   with its name and the datatype of variables being passed into it as arguments),
	   and defining the complete function after the main() function has ended. e.g.

			void menu(); //The function's prototype
			int main()
			{
				menu();
			}
			void menu()
			{
				//...
			}

x---------------------------------------------------------------------x

6: Extra Semicolons:

for(int x=0; x<100; x++);
cout<<x;

"Why does it output 100?"

	The syntax is incorrect. For a 'for loop', there are no semicolons
	outside the condition stating paranthesis.
	The correct syntax for this loop to operate is:

		for(int x = 0; x < 100; x++)
		{
			cout << x;
		}

x---------------------------------------------------------------------x

7: Overstepping array boundaries:

int array[10];
//...
for(int x=1; x<=10; x++)
cout<<array[x];

"Why doesn't it output the correct values?"

	When an array of ten elements is declared, it means that the starting
	index of the array is from 0 (zero) till one less than the stated size
	of the array, 9 (nine) in this case. Although the loop above operates
	10 times, but it skips the element at index 0 and prints on the screen
	element value stored at index 1, and goes one index further than the
	actual bound of the loop, thus stating a garbage value for the last output.
	The correct code would be:

		int array[10];
		//...
		for(int x=0; x<10; x++)
		{
			cout<<array[x];
		}

x---------------------------------------------------------------------x

8: Integer division

double half = 1/2;

This code sets half to 0 not 0.5! Why?

	As 1 and 2 are integer constants, the value stored in the variable
	would be an integer. If only, the numerator was of the double datatype
	the result stored in the variable would have been a double.

		double half = 1.0 / 2;

	Another way was if both the numerator and the denominator both had
	values with a decimal point in them.

		double half = 1.0 / 2.0;

x---------------------------------------------------------------------x

9: Variable Name Styles

Take a look at the below program. Can you see anything wrong?

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

main()
{
char CatName[20] = "fluffy";
char dogName[20] = "fido";
char rat_Name[20] = "fester";
int Catage = 3;
int dogs_age = 4;
int ratage = 1;
char myPet[20];
int itsAge;

strcpy(myPet,rat_Name);
itsAge = ratage;
printf("My pet is %s\n",myPet);
}

Besides the obviously bizarre choice of having a pet rat, do you notice anything? 

	The main() function does not state a return type.

x---------------------------------------------------------------------x

10 Misusing the && and || operators:

int value;
do
{
//...
value=10;
}while(!(value==10) || !(value==20))

"Huh? Even though value is 10 the program loops. Why?"

	The program loops because the loop operates only as according to the
	conditional statement. But the improper use of the operator causes
	improper functioning of the loop.
	The || operator operates in the condition as if any of the stated value
	or both of thr stated value is true, the overall condition is returned as
	true. The && operator returns the overall value of the condition as true
	only if both the stated conditions are true.
